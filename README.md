# Andy Sharpe Tavernlight Games technical trial submission

### Environment

- As proof of a proper envirionment setup I have included the files for theforgottenserver with the proper configuration as a part of the repository.

- While not included in this repo, I used the OTClient with the Tibia 1098 client version for validation of my solutions.

### Question Answers

- The answers to questions 1-4 are in a folder named "Answers", with each question having its own file (EX: "Q1.lua").

- The answer to question 5 can be found at /data/spells/scripts/attack/Q5.lua with some changes in /data/spells/spells.xml. It is only partially complete at the moment, but a video of my current progress can be seen in the Answers folder in the file "Q5 In Progress.mp4".

- The answer to question 6 is not yet complete.

- The answer to question 7 is not yet complete.

### Contact Information
