# Andy Sharpe Tavernlight Games technical trial submission

### Environment

- As proof of a proper envirionment setup I have included the files for theforgottenserver with the proper configuration as a part of the repository.

- While not included in this repo, I used the OTClient with the Tibia 1098 client version for validation of my solutions.

### Question Answers

- The answers to questions 1-4 are in a folder named "Answers", with each question having its own file (EX: "Q1.lua").

- The code for question 5 can be found at /data/spells/scripts/attack/Q5.lua with some changes in /data/spells/spells.xml. A video of the spell working in game can be found in the Answers folder under the name "Q5.mp4". Details about my implementation choices can be found within the comments in the previously mentioned Q5.lua script.

- The answer to question 6 is not yet complete.

- The answer to question 7 is not yet complete.
