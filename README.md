# Andy Sharpe Tavernlight Games technical trial submission

### Environment

- As proof of a proper environment setup I have included the files for theforgottenserver and otclient with proper configurations as a part of the repository.

- While not included in this repo, I used Uniform Server to host the MySQL database and signup/character creation page for the game.

### Question Answers

- The answers to questions 1-4 are in a folder named "Answers", with each question having its own file (EX: "Q1.lua").

- The code for question 5 can be found at /theforgottenserver/data/spells/scripts/attack/Q5.lua with some changes in /theforgottenserver/data/spells/spells.xml. A video of the spell working in game can be found in the Answers folder under the name "Q5.mp4". Details about my implementation choices can be found within the comments in the previously mentioned Q5.lua script.

- The code for question 6 can be found at /theforgottenserver/data/spells/scripts/support/Q6.lua with some changes in /theforgottenserver/data/spells/spells.xml. I was not able to figure out how to replicate the shaders found in the reference video, but I have created the dash move itself with a placeholder animation. A video of the spell working in game can be found in the Answers folder under the name "Q6.mp4". Details about my implementation choices can be found within the comments in the previously mentioned Q6.lua script.

- The files for question 7 can be found in the folder /otclient/modules/game_jumpmenu, with the main file being "jumpmenu.lua".  A video of the menu working in game can be found in the Answers folder under the name "Q7.mp4". Details about my implementation choices can be found within the comments in the previously mentioned files.
